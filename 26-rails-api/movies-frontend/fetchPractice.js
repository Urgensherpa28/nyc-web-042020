To answer the following question please spin up the json-server database in this directory.
 - `json-server -w db.json`

You can test your code in the browser console. 
Try to answer these questions without looking at any other code.


1. Following RESTful conventions, what's the HTTP method and path used to create a new resource in the database (e.g., a movie)?

2. What do POST, PATCH, and DELETE fetch requests require that a GET fetch request does not?

3. Why do we not need to pass the id as a property of the body when we make a DELETE fetch request?

4. Write the fetch request to get all the movies from the db and log the response to the console.

5. Write the fetch request to change the title of "Jaws" to "Big Fish, Big Teeth".

6. What data does json-server return when we make a POST request to create a new movie? What does it return when we make a DELETE request to remove a movie? How can we test this?
